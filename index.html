<h2>Info about me!</h2>

<h3>Name</h3>
<li>My name is <strong>Jonathan Ropp</strong></li>

<h3>School</h3>
<li>I am a second year student majoring in computer science</li>

<h3>Web Dev skills</h3>
<li>My skills are at about a <strong>3</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>I first used HTML and CSS in highschool in a very basic intro class
and have not used it since then. I think that once<br> I get back into the
groove, I should pick it up again pretty fast</li>
</ul>

<h3>Goals for this class</h3>
<li>I hope to learn not only how to code websites, but also how to 
publish, maintain, and create successful useful websites</li>

<h3>Piazza</h3>
<li>I have signed up for Piazza <em>(And excited to use it!)</em></li>

<h3>Interesting fact</h3>
<li>To be honest, I am not super interesting, but one thing that is going
on right now is that I am on the alternate list to be a<br> Resident Assistant
here on campus! Basically, I am just waiting for another RA to quit so
that I can take their spot! :)</li>
