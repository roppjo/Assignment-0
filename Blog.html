<h2>Assignment 0</h2>
<h4>9/24/2016</h4>

<p>I think that the hardest part of this assignment to me was just 
learning my way around Github. When I am just writing the HTML code,<br>
I do fine, but commiting and pushing and everything else is brand
new to me and it will take a while to get used to.</p>
<p>Learning my way around Github and Piazza were both new to me.
While I have had a bit of HTML experience, this was the first time<br>
that I did it without have my hand held, which was satisfying.</p>
<p>The Github tuturial was extremely helpful as I would have been 
completely lost without it. </p>
